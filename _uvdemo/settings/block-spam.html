    <div class="components-topics">
        <p class="paragraph1">UVdesk has the feature to block unwanted spam messages popping up again and again into your Mailbox. These spam messages are annoying and consume a lot of space as well.</p>
        
        <p class="component-sub-title"><b>Steps to blacklisting and whitelisting the particular senders:</b></p>
        <ol class="paragraph1">
            <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Login to your UVdesk Support Panel.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> On the Dashboard, you will see <b>"SETTINGS"</b> menu and under it, you will find <b>"Spam Settings"</b>.</li>

            <br/>
            <img class='ipsum-logo' src="/assets/images/settings/spam-setting.png" alt="uvdesk-image">

            <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Click on the <b>"Spam Settings"</b> icon and then you will see <b>Blacklist</b> and <b>Whitelist</b> boxes.</li>
            
            <br/>
            <img class='ipsum-logo' src="/assets/images/settings/spam2.png" alt="uvdesk-image">

            <p class="paragraph1">Blacklist- It will reject all the messages which are coming from the specific sender ( email address or I.P Address) which are entered in the box of the blacklist.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1">Whitelist- It will accept all the messages which are coming from the sender ( email address or I.P Address) which are entered in the box of the whitelist.</p>
        </ol>

        <p class="paragraph1">These two boxes will accept the following:</p>
        <ol class="paragraph1">
            <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> An Email address.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Domain Name.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> IP Address.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="component-sub-title"><b>Points to Ponder:</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph1"><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> By entering the IP address of the users in the box of the blacklist, they will get completely restricted visiting the support site.</p>

        <p class="image-heading"><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> 
                If we put the same data in the two boxes then what's the use of having the white list?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1"><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> The answer is that if we enter the email address like company@support.com and domain as @support.com in both the boxes then in that condition the users with that domain name will be barred from submitting tickets.</p>
        <p class="paragraph1"><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> But, the user whose complete email address (company@support.com) has entered in the white box with the same domain will have the access to the site and submit the support requests.</p>
